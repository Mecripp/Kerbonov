This is a revival of the Kerbonov Parts Pack

Be sure to read the Installation instructions below.

The Kerbonov Kn-2 module is a compact 3 Kerbal cockpit for use with intermediate
sized aircraft. It includes an IVA view.

The Kerbonov Kn-7 cockpit also seats 3, and is designed for use withthe MK2 
spaceplane fuselage parts.

Also included are several additional parts:

	Hood ornament: A snazzy little chrome doodad for classing up your horrible
		spaceplane / rocket death dragster.
	Probe RCS: A tiny, low powered RCS block with its own small monopropellant
		supply built in. Good for unmanned micro-probes.
	Drop tank: Lightweight, streamlined jet fuel pod. Includes its own built in
		decoupler for when it runs dry.
	Radial Micro Decoupler: What it says on the label. Now itsy bitsy ships can
		benefit from asparagus staging too.
	RATO Booster: A bit like a bigger, heftier sepratron, except stackable.
	Grid Fins: Fits a very large effective surface area into a compact (front to 
		back) package. Can be retracted when not in use.
	Heavy Duty Command Seat: A tougher, heavier, stack-attachable external command
		seat.
	Small Inline Passenger Can: A single-seat, 1.25m diameter hitchhiker container
		for spaceplanes.
	Mini Turbojet: A jet engine suitable for ultralight aircraft and UAVs.
	VHF Antenna: A fixed, stack-mountable 5M-rated standard antenna.
		a few others

IMPORTANT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

IMPORTANT NOTE: The grid fins are dependent upon the mod RetractableLiftingSurface Module,

One of the parts (a tank) uses some Squad textures.  Unfortunately, in 1.5, some
of the textures it uses have been moved into the zDeprecated directory, and are
not directly accessible during loading.  This causes some textures to be missing.

To address this, I've provided a pair of scripts, one to be used on Windows and
the other to be used on both Linux & OSX.  These only need to be run one time


Windows Instructions
====================
Open the Kerbonov folder in Windows Explorer
Double-click on the file Windows_CopyTextures.bat (note that on most systems,
you won't see the .bat)


Linux & OSX Desktop Instructions
================================
Open the Kerbonov folder Desktop 
Double-click on the file:  BashCopyTextures.sh


Linux & OSX Terminal Instructions
=================================
Change to the GameData/Kerbonov directory
Type the following:
	bash BashCopyTextures.sh
